### **Project Overview:**
This repository showcases the work completed during the data science internship, involving three distinct tasks related to data science.

### **Task 1: Stock Price Prediction using LSTM:**
In this task, an LSTM-based stock price prediction system was implemented using Jupyter Notebook. The model utilizes historical stock data to predict future stock prices. The code is available in the Jupyter Notebook format, providing a comprehensive demonstration of LSTM-based time series forecasting for stock prices.

### **Task 2: Titanic Survival Classification:**
The second task involves creating a classification system to predict the survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic. Several factors, such as socio-economic status, age, and gender, were analyzed to determine their influence on survival rates. The implemented system helps identify the key factors that likely lead to survival during the Titanic disaster. The code and analysis for this task are available within the Jupyter Notebook.

### **Task 3: Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Network:**
In the third task, a handwritten digit recognition system was developed using the MNIST dataset. This project focuses on recognizing scanned images of handwritten digits utilizing neural network techniques. The code demonstrates the process of training a model to accurately identify and classify handwritten digits from scanned images. The Jupyter Notebook provides detailed insights into the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
